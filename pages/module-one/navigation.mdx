There are two ways to navigate between routes in Next.js:

- Using the `<Link>` Component
- Using the useRouter Hook

In our app, we will focus heavily on the `<Link>` Component;

## `<Link>` Component

`<Link>` is a built-in component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.

You can use it by importing it from `next/link`, and passing a href prop to the component:

```jsx
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>;
}
```

## Exercise

- Using `next/link` edit your Navbar to have the links to /home, /about, /events, and /categories.
- Edit your Footer to have the links to /home, /privacy-policy and /terms.

### Solution

Checkout my implemented [Navbar](https://github.com/choubari/RSVP-Event-App/blob/master/components/navbar.tsx) and [Footer](https://github.com/choubari/RSVP-Event-App/blob/master/components/footer.tsx).
