Before we start working on our project, we’ll review the new features and concepts introduced in Next.js 13.

If you’ve worked with previous versions of Next.js, you might already be familiar with the `pages` directory. Any file created inside of the pages directory would act as a route in the UI. For example, `pages/home.jsx` would take care of the `/home` route:

![Next.js Pages Directory](public/images/pages-dir.png)

Just like files inside of the `pages` directory, routing with the `app` directory is controlled via the folders inside of it. The UI for a particular route is defined by a `page.jsx` file inside of the folder.

Therefore, a folder structure that looks like `app/profile/settings/page.jsx` will take care of rendering the `/profile/settings` route:

![Next.js App Directory](public/images/app-dir.png)

> The new `app` directory works alongside the `pages` directory to support incremental adoption and provide other new features like server-side rendering and static-site generation.

## Next.js 13: App Directory

In our course, we will put deep focus on the new App Directory architecture introduced in Next.js 13 (stable since )

This page provides an overview of the file and folder structure of a Next.js project. It covers top-level files and folders, configuration files, and routing conventions within the app directory.
