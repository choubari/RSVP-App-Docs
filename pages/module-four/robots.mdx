## What is robots.txt?

A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site.

## Robots.txt vs Sitemap.xml

The purpose of a Sitemap is to indicate the search engines of all the webpages that it should crawl on your website. Robots. txt: A robots. txt file is created to signify the search engines which pages to crawl and which pages to omit.

## How to add a Robots File

With Next.js, you can add or generate a `robots.txt` file that matches the [Robots Exclusion Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt#Standard) in the root of `app` directory to tell search engine crawlers which URLs they can access on your site.

### Static Robots File

Add directly your txt file in the app directory with the links you want search engines to crawl and the ones to ommit.

**Example:**

```txt
// app/robots.txt

User-Agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /private/

Sitemap: https://acme.com/sitemap.xml
```

### Dynamic Robots File

Add a `robots.js` or `robots.ts` file that returns a [Robots object](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots#robots-object).

```js
import { MetadataRoute } from "next";

const home = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL;

export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  // Find all unpublished events.
  //   const disallowedEvents = [""];

  //   const disallowedPaths = [...disallowedEvents, "/api/contact"];
  const disallowedPaths = ["/api/events", "/api/categories"];

  return {
    sitemap: `${home}/sitemap.xml`,
    rules: {
      userAgent: "*",
      allow: "/",
      disallow: disallowedPaths,
    },
  };
}
```

This code defines a function that returns a robots configuration for a Next.js application. It specifies which paths should be disallowed for web crawlers (e.g., search engine bots). Specifically, it disallows bots from accessing /api/events and /api/categories paths. Additionally, it provides a link to the sitemap located at the root of the application domain.

## Exercise

> You can use the same file above to create your `robots.js` file!
