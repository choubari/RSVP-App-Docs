- **Event Details**: Click on any event to view more about it â€“ from the description, venue, to the time and date.
- **Swift RSVP**: No more long forms! RSVP with a click, and the event is added to your list.

### Technical Highlights

Here's a glimpse of the features and Next.js aspects we'll touch upon while building:

- **Dynamic Routing**: Handle different event details with dynamic routes.
- **Data Fetching**: Fetch event details on the fly, ensuring up-to-date information.
- **Local Storage**: Handle RSVPs locally, giving instant feedback to the user.
- **Styling with TailwindCSS**: Achieve a modern and responsive design effortlessly.
- **SEO Ready**: Each event page will be optimized for search engines.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Leveraging Next.js's in-built capabilities like `next/image` for optimized image loading.

The beauty of our application lies not just in its user-friendliness but also in the underlying powerful features that Next.js offers. As we build, you'll see how seamlessly these features integrate, making the development process smoother and the end product robust.

The goal is not only to understand how to build this application but to grasp Next.js principles and best practices so that you can create even more complex and feature-rich applications in the future.
