## Client Components

Client Components allows you to write interactive UI that can be rendered on the client at request time. In Next.js, client rendering is opt-in, meaning you have to explicitly decide what components React should render on the client.

This page will go through how Client Components work, how they're rendered, and when you might use them.

## Benefits of Client Rendering

There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the client, including:

- **Interactivity**: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.
- **Browser APIs**: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like geolocation or localStorage, allowing you to build UI for specific use cases.

## Using Client Components in Next.js

To use Client Components, you can add the React `"use client"` directive at the top of a file, above your imports.

`"use client"` is used to declare a boundary between a Server and Client Component modules. This means that by defining a `"use client"` in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle.

```jsx
// components/counter.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Exercise

> Create a Counter component in `/components/counter.tsx` and import it in any page we've created, for example in the about page!

> Since the Counter requires interactivity with useState, it is a Client Component!
