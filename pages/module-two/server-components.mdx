## Server Components

React Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and optionally cached on the server. In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and partial rendering, and there are three different server rendering strategies:

- [Static Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default)
- [Dynamic Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering)
- [Streaming](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#streaming)

This page will go through how Server Components work, when you might use them, and the different server rendering strategies.

## Benefits of Server Rendering

There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the server, including:

- **Data Fetching**: Server Components allow you to move data fetching to the server, closer to your data source. This can improve performance by reducing time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering, and the amount of requests the client needs to make.
- **Security**: Server Components allow you to keep sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, without the risk of exposing them to the client.
- **Caching**: By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users. This can improve performance and reduce cost by reducing the amount of rendering and data fetching done on each request.
- **Bundle Sizes**: Server Components allow you to keep large dependencies that previously would impact the client JavaScript bundle size on the server. This is beneficial for users with slower internet or less powerful devices, as the client does not have to download, parse and execute any JavaScript for Server Components.
- **Initial Page Load and [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/fcp/)** (FCP): On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse and execute the JavaScript needed to render the page.
- **Search Engine Optimization and Social Network Shareability**: The rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots to index your pages and social network bots to generate social card previews for your pages.
- **Streaming**: Server Components allow you to split the rendering work into chunks and stream them to the client as they become ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server.

## Using Server Components in Next.js

By default, Next.js uses Server Components. This allows you to automatically implement server rendering with no additional configuration, and you can opt into using Client Components when needed, see Client Components.

## Exercise

> To Understand more server components, go to any page we've created, for example `/about` and run a console.log('Hello World!')

> Open the console of your browser and the terminal of your IDE to see where the Hello World is logged!
