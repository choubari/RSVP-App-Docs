Congratulations on compelting this tough module while building most features of our app!

But before moving on to another exiting module: Performance!

Let's finish building our app by adding more features!

- Style your pages with TailwindCSS or any CSS way... especially `/events`, `/events/1234`, `/categories`..
- Implement the RSVP button with local storage access (a challenge!!)

- You can add more features [suggested here](http://localhost:3000/features-to-add#features-to-add), and checkout the final code solution proposed by me :p in [Github](https://github.com/choubari/RSVP-Event-App/)!
