`next/font` will automatically optimize your fonts (including custom fonts) and remove external network requests for improved privacy and performance.

`next/font` includes built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with zero layout shift, thanks to the underlying CSS `size-adjust` property used.

This new font system also allows you to conveniently use all Google Fonts with performance and privacy in mind. CSS and font files are downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static assets. **No requests are sent to Google by the browser**.

## Google Fonts

Automatically self-host any Google Font. Fonts are included in the deployment and served from the same domain as your deployment. No requests are sent to Google by the browser.

Get started by importing the font you would like to use from `next/font/google` as a function. We recommend using variable fonts for the best performance and flexibility.

```jsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Roboto } from "next/font/google";

const roboto = Roboto({
  weight: "400",
  subsets: ["latin"],
  display: "swap",
});

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={roboto.className}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Local Fonts

Import `next/font/local` and specify the `src` of your local font file.

We recommend using [variable fonts](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts) for the best performance and flexibility.

```jsx
// app/layout.tsx
import localFont from "next/font/local";

// Font files can be colocated inside of `app`
const myFont = localFont({
  src: "./my-font.woff2",
  display: "swap",
});

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={myFont.className}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## With TailwindCSS

`next/font` can be used with Tailwind CSS through a CSS variable.

In the example below, we use the font `Inter` from `next/font/google` (you can use any font from Google or Local Fonts). Load your font with the `variable` option to define your CSS variable name and assign it to `inter`. Then, use `inter.variable` to add the CSS variable to your HTML document.

```jsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  display: "swap",
  variable: "--font-inter",
});

const roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  display: "swap",
  variable: "--font-roboto-mono",
});

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Finally, add the CSS variable to your Tailwind CSS config:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ["var(--font-inter)"],
        mono: ["var(--font-roboto-mono)"],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

## Exercise

Apply what you learned before to :

- Change Logo's Font and the Home page Headline text
- Change the whole text that is nested to the (legal) route group; you may want to use it inside `/app/(legal)/layout.tsx`
- Change fonts as you want, get creative!
