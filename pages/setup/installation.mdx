# Project Setup

First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

System Requirements:

- Node.js 16.14 or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

If you don’t have **Node.js** installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.

> If you are on Windows, we recommend downloading [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is another option.

## Create next app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```sh
1 What is your project named? my-app
2 Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
3 Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
4 Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
5 Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
6 Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
7 Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
8 What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

First choose the project name, for example 'nextjs-demo'. Then choose yes on all steps except 5 _(no need to)_, and 8 _(we can do that later)_. Then hit enter on the last step.

After the prompts, `create-next-app` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

Great, now navigate to your project `cd nextjs-demo` and open it on your IDE!
