> This website serves as a documentation tutorial for my workshop : **Learn Modern Web Development with Next.js**.

This course was presented as a hands-on-lab at [Devoxx Morocco](https://devoxx.ma) 2023, by [Kawtar CHOUBARI](https://Choubari.com)

During this written course, we will build a Quick RSVP Event app as a hands-on-lab, you can follow along and build a similar app at home by starting here [documentation tutorial](https://nextjs.choubari.com).

The goal is to build a quick RSVP Event application, while learning web development with Next.js 13 core features:

- Client Components
- Server Components
- Routing, Layouts, Errors, Loading UI...
- Data Fetching on the client and on the server
- Route Handlers, Suspense, Async/Await...
- Env Variables
- SEO (metadata, openGraph, robots, sitemap..)
- `next/image`, `next/font`, `next/link` ...
- Along with TypeScript and TailwindCSS ðŸ’™

To make it easy for ourselves, We are going to use an API based on my [Guichet.com](https://guichet.com) events data, hosted on a json-server, and handle the RSVP part on local storage.

In case of difficulties, reach out to me live at the conference/workshop, or drop me DM on [Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/choubari_) if you're doing this exercise at home!

At the end, you can checkout the whole source code of this application in this Github Repository, and customize your app with [more features](https://nextjs.choubari.com/features-to-add)! **Stay Creative!**
