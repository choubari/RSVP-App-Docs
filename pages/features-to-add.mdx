## Features to add

You can go and add more features to this RSVP application and make it stand out!

- [x] Show a Ribbon Label on the Event Details Page, to show if the event is free or paid and show the event status (canceled, postponed, sold out...)
- [x] Show a Ribbon Label on the Events Page, to quickly notice sold out events.
- [x] Filter Events by Categories.
- [x] Choosing an category from the Category Page redirects you to filtered events of that category.
- [ ] Searchbar for events.
- [ ] User Auth, and RSVP by email.
- [ ] Send email sequences (when RSVP, events you may like...).

Some of these features have been implemented in my [live demo app](https://rsvp.choubari.com), you can try building them by yourself as a challenge, and then check out the [open source code](https://github.com/choubari/RSVP-Event-App).
